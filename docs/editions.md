# The two editions

What the public edition ships and what it leaves out, how the restricted datasets are replaced, and the
gates that prove a build may be redistributed. Back to the [developer guide](developing.md); the pipeline steps
named here are described in [Building the data](pipeline.md).

The build has two editions. The **public** edition is what may be redistributed — Apache-2.0 code, CC BY-SA 4.0 data and content — and it is the default: `npm run dev` serves it and `npm run build` builds it into `dist/`. The **private** edition is everything the pipeline can make; it stays on this machine, and `npm run dev:private` serves it and `npm run build:private` builds it into `dist-private/`.

```bash
npm run build               # atlas-manifest → content → vite → filter dist/data → check-public
npm run build:private       # the full edition into dist-private/, unfiltered and with no gate
npm run check-public        # re-run just the gate over an existing dist/
npm run check-tree          # the repository guard (also a pre-commit hook: npm run hooks:install)
npx vite preview --outDir dist --port 5183
node scripts/shots-public-edition.mjs        # graceful-degradation checks + qa/shots/public-edition/
node scripts/shots-public-brainstem.mjs      # the public edition's brainstem nuclei + qa/shots/public-brainstem/
node scripts/shots-public-cerebellum.mjs     # the public edition's cerebellar lobules + qa/shots/public-cerebellum/
node scripts/shots-public-cord.mjs           # the public edition's cord MRI + qa/shots/public-cord-mri/
```

**What is excluded, and why.** A dataset leaves the public edition when its licence is marked `nc: true` (non-commercial) or `no_redistribution: true` in `pipeline/config/sources.yaml`. Nothing else is special-cased: change the flag and the edition changes with it. The same four datasets are `group: restricted` in `pipeline/config/sources.yaml`, so `atlas-download` fetches them only on the `private` branch or with `ATLAS_ALLOW_RESTRICTED=1`, and a default pipeline run therefore builds the public edition.

| Dataset | Licence | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Harvard-Oxford (FSL) | `FSL-NC` | held back pending review; FSL relicensed it to CC BY-SA 4.0 on 2025-08-05 |
| Diedrichsen cerebellar atlas | `CC-BY-ND` | no derivatives may be distributed, and we mesh the volume |
| Brainstem Navigator | `BrainstemNavigator-NC-ND` | non-commercial, and clause 2 forbids passing derived files outside the organisation |
| PAM50 template | `PAM50-unlicensed` | the repository ships no licence at all, so derived files are treated as research-use-only |

That takes out **202 of 657 meshes (15.7 MB)** — 96 Harvard-Oxford parcels, 65 Brainstem Navigator nuclei, 34 Diedrichsen cerebellar lobules and the 7 cord segment blocks, which are Z-Anatomy geometry but are *cut at PAM50 level boundaries* and so are PAM50-derived themselves — plus the 3 PAM50 cord volumes (`cord_t2`, `cord_t1`, `labels_spine`) with `grids.cord` and the `volumes/labels_spine.json` LUT — all of which the public edition then refills from its own template, below — 4 licences, 4 sources, and the 1.28 M voxels those atlases painted into `labels_anat` (zeroed, so the label volume no longer carries them either). What is left is **592 meshes (36.3 MB)** — the 460 that survive the cut plus the 132 public-only replacements below (62 CerebrA cortical parcels, 25 CerebNet cerebellar lobule and vermis parcels, and 45 openly licensed or landmark-anchored stand-ins for the brainstem nuclei and the cord blocks) — all 16 systems, the MNI T1/T2 volumes, the remaining label volumes, and the complete authored content — 379 structures, every syndrome, pathway, topic and quiz.

**Replacements for the two parcellations.** Losing Harvard-Oxford and Diedrichsen would leave the public edition with no cortical gyri and no cerebellar lobules at all, so both are stood in for with permissively licensed data that ships *only* in that edition (`edition: "public"` on the mesh record; one `atlas-manifest` run keeps those records in the public manifest and leaves them out of the private one, where the original parcellation is there instead).

* **Cortex — CerebrA** (Manera et al., *Sci Data* 2020; G-Node [doi:10.12751/g-node.be5e62](https://doi.gin.g-node.org/10.12751/g-node.be5e62/), **CC0 1.0**): the Mindboggle-101 DKT31 labelling registered and hand-corrected onto MNI-ICBM152 2009c, meshed here as **62 parcels** (31 per side, `dkt-precentral-l` and friends) through the same label path, budget and welding as the Harvard-Oxford gyri. CerebrA is defined on the *symmetric* 2009c template, on our exact 1 mm grid; `atlas-atlas-meshes` SyN-warps the symmetric T1w onto our asymmetric one and carries the labels over with `genericLabel` when antspyx (the `[warp]` extra) is installed — which measured better on this data than reading them as they are (cortical Dice against DKT31-in-2009cAsym 0.587 → 0.610, subcortical Dice against `aseg` 0.760 → 0.770, label voxels outside our brain mask 8147 → 5499) — and falls back to the identity reading otherwise. Each mesh records which: `alignment: "warped-sym-to-asym"` or `"nlin2009csym-identity"`.
* **Cerebellum — a CerebNet segmentation of our own template** (source `fastsurfer_cerebellum`, **CC BY-SA 4.0**). No openly licensed cerebellar *lobule* atlas exists to copy, so the public edition makes its own: **FastSurfer v2.5.4** (Deep-MI, **Apache-2.0**; Henschel et al., *NeuroImage* 2020, [PMC7898243](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7898243/)) is run on `raw/mni_t1w/tpl-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_res-01_T1w.nii.gz` — FastSurferVINN for the aseg/DKT prior, then the **CerebNet** cerebellum module (Faber et al., *NeuroImage* 2022, [PMC9771831](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9771831/)) — and the label volume that comes out is our derivative of the MNI template, not anyone else's atlas. Both checkpoint sets are open (VINN [doi:10.5281/zenodo.10390573](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10390573), Apache-2.0; CerebNet [doi:10.5281/zenodo.10390742](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10390742), CC BY 4.0). It is nearest-neighbour resampled from FastSurfer's conformed 256³ grid onto the template grid, so it is `native-mni`, and meshed as **25 parcels** — 10 lobules per side (`cerebellar-lobule-crus-i-fs-l` and friends) and 5 vermian strips — through the same label path, budgets, colours and welding as the private-edition lobules. CerebNet's vermis is coarser: VI, VII (crus I + crus II + VIIb), VIII (VIIIa + VIIIb), IX, X, five parcels where the private edition has eight. Measured against the private lobules on this data, Dice is 0.68–0.91 per lobule (crus I 0.91, lobule VI 0.84–0.87, the small lobule X 0.73–0.77), 0.86 over the vermis and **0.925** over the whole cerebellar cortex — 0.94 against the `aseg` cerebellar cortex, which is the ceiling any lobule split can reach. Each lobule, vermis, tonsil and flocculonodular entry carries a pitfall with its own number. The **deep nuclei are not segmented by CerebNet**, so `dentate-nucleus`, `interposed-nucleus` and `fastigial-nucleus` still fall back to `cerebellar-white-matter-l/-r` (MNI licence, both editions), and the `aseg` `cerebellar-hemisphere-l/-r` stays as the coarse fallback underneath everything. The run is not a download: `pipeline/raw/fastsurfer_cerebellum/SOURCE.json` records the tool commit, the checkpoints and the exact commands, the source is marked `generated: true` in `sources.yaml` so `atlas-download` leaves the folder alone, and `atlas-atlas-meshes` prints `[fastsurfer_cerebellum] skipped` and carries on when it is not there. `node scripts/shots-public-cerebellum.mjs` renders the lobules from below, behind and from the midline into `qa/shots/public-cerebellum/` after asserting that the loaded manifest carries no non-commercial cerebellar mesh at all.

The bridge between the two parcellations is authored in **`pipeline/config/ho_to_dkt.yaml`**: for every Harvard-Oxford entry, the DKT parcels covering the same cortex and one line saying why (HO frontal pole → `superior-frontal` + `rostral-middle-frontal`; HO Heschl → `transverse-temporal`; HO cingulate anterior/posterior → the four DKT cingulate parcels; and so on). Those ids are *appended* to the entry's `meshIds`, so every gyrus, lobe and lobule entry still lights up a surface in both editions, and each DKT parcel's `structureId` points back at one of them — `0 manifest structures without content` holds either way. What is left with no mesh in the public edition is only what nothing redistributable covers, and after the brainstem and cord work below that is **4 entries**: three cord entries that point only at the PAM50-cut blocks or the enlargement overlays (`cervical-enlargement`, `intermediolateral-column`, `segment-vertebral-levels`) and one topic (`topic-cortical-layers-organization`, which spotlit Harvard-Oxford gyri). No brainstem entry is left without a surface.

**Brainstem nuclei in the public edition.** The 65 Brainstem Navigator nuclei are the largest block with no redistributable replacement, and only one of them has an openly licensed counterpart: the **locus coeruleus**. `atlas-lc-metamask` (source `lc_metamask`, `atlas-download --with brainstem-open`) meshes the Dahl et al. LC **meta mask** — a consensus volume of interest pooled across six published LC maps, shared in OSF project [sf2ky](https://osf.io/sf2ky/) under that project's **CC BY 4.0** licence (verified live against the OSF API) — as `locus-coeruleus-meta-l/-r`, `edition: "public"`, structure id `locus-coeruleus`, so the public edition has an LC where the private edition has the 7 T one. The masks are 0.5 mm on the FSL MNI152 box, so they are read as they are and tagged `nlin6-identity` like every other FSL-space atlas here; the mask is a *sampling* volume of interest and is deliberately larger than the nucleus (40 mm³ left, 34 mm³ right), which the entry's pitfall says.

**Landmark-anchored markers for the rest.** Placing the remaining nuclei at published MNI centroids is impossible: the 7 T atlas papers (Bianciardi 2015 [PMC4684653](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4684653/), Bianciardi 2018 [PMC5670016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5670016/), García-Gomar 2019 [PMC6694208](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6694208/), Singh 2019 [PMC6989551](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6989551/), Singh 2021 [PMC8817713](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8817713/), García-Gomar 2022 [PMC9018552](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9018552/)) publish label *volumes* and segmentation accuracies, not centroid coordinates, and a centroid measured from the toolkit's own files may not be published. What those papers *do* give is a size, and that is enough for an honest **location marker**: an ellipsoid of the published volume, put where a textbook puts the nucleus relative to geometry the atlas already holds openly, and clipped to the `aseg` brainstem dilated 1 mm. `atlas-derived` builds **30** of them from **`pipeline/config/brainstem_landmarks.yaml`**, which carries per nucleus the volume, the bibliography ref it comes from, the topographic relation and the anchor recipe — a point set (`aseg` brainstem or fourth ventricle, a MASSP20 nucleus, an HCP1065 tract, an exported Z-Anatomy object such as the inferior olive, or another openly licensed mask such as the locus coeruleus meta mask), an optional world-mm level band, one rule per axis and an offset in millimetres. Two of the sizes are read off a plotted bar rather than a table — Bianciardi 2018 publishes the cuneiform and paramedian raphe label volumes only in its Figure 3C — and those two say "approximately" everywhere they appear, in the config, in the manifest's `derived` line and in the entry's pitfall. The records are tagged `derived: "landmark-anchored: …"` and `edition: "public"`, hidden by default, and each entry carries a pitfall saying the surface marks a location and not a boundary.

| Nucleus | Anchored on | Volume (published) | Centre (MNI mm) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raphe magnus | `aseg` brainstem, ventral third at the pontomedullary junction | 16 mm³ (Bianciardi 2015) | 0, −33.2, −52.9 |
| Raphe obscurus | `aseg` brainstem, dorsal medulla below the obex | 16 mm³ (as raphe magnus; none published) | 0, −45.3, −61.6 |
| Raphe pallidus | `aseg` brainstem, ventral medulla just dorsal to the pyramids | 16 mm³ (as raphe magnus; none published) | 0, −34.8, −59.7 |
| Viscero-sensory-motor complex | floor of the `aseg` fourth ventricle at and below the obex | 86 mm³/side (Singh 2019) | ±3.5, −41.5, −52.7 |
| Superior olivary complex | HCP1065 medial lemniscus at the trapezoid-body level | 16 R / 20 L mm³ (García-Gomar 2019) | ±8.5, −31.1, −44.1 |
| Lateral parabrachial n. | lateral to the HCP1065 superior cerebellar peduncle | 54 mm³/side (Singh 2019) | ±9.4, −35.2, −24.2 |
| Medial parabrachial n. | medial to the HCP1065 superior cerebellar peduncle | 47 mm³/side (Singh 2019) | ±3.4, −37.2, −24.2 |
| Mesencephalic reticular formation | lateral to the MASSP20 periaqueductal grey | 373 R / 369 L mm³ (Singh 2021) | ±9.1, −30.0, −10.7 |

Nothing in that construction is read from, measured on, or copied out of a Brainstem Navigator file; the anchors are open datasets and the sizes are numbers printed in open-access papers. `node scripts/shots-public-brainstem.mjs` renders them inside a translucent brainstem into `qa/shots/public-brainstem/` after asserting that the loaded manifest carries no Brainstem Navigator mesh at all.

**Nothing brainstem-side is content-only any more.** The nine entries that used to keep their full text and no surface here — the isthmic, superior medullary and inferior medullary reticular formations, the subcoeruleus, cuneiform, parvicellular reticular alpha and microcellular tegmental–parabigeminal nuclei, and the caudal–rostral linear and paramedian raphe — all have a landmark-anchored marker now, because open-access volumes for all nine were found: Singh 2021 tabulates isRt, MiTg-PBG and CLi-RLi; García-Gomar 2022 gives SubC, PCRtA, sMRt and iMRt (and, incidentally, the raphe obscurus and pallidus volumes, which had been standing in on the raphe magnus and are now their own published numbers); Bianciardi 2018 plots CnF and PMnR in its Figure 3C, and those two are marked approximate. The laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, the oral pontine reticular nucleus, the parabrachial complex and the mesencephalic reticular formation are covered by the Harvard Ascending Arousal Network atlas v2.0 (Edlow et al. 2024, Dryad, CC0 1.0; eight `*-aan-*` meshes), which has to be downloaded once in a browser into `pipeline/raw/aan_atlas/` because Dryad serves its files behind a bot check, then `atlas-download --with brainstem-open` and `atlas-aan` build and verify it. The PAM50-cut cord blocks and the PAM50-cut filum stay private; their public stand-ins are the vertebral-landmark cuts.

**A cord MRI the public edition may actually ship.** Dropping PAM50 used to leave the public edition with no MRI at all below the foramen magnum — the slices simply stopped, and the cord toggle hid itself. The replacement is built out of data that may be redistributed, in two stages: `atlas-spine-generic` (source `spine_generic`, `atlas-download --with spine-open`, about 160 MB) and `atlas-fudan-spine` (source `lumbosacral_fudan`) each write a **straightened template** into `pipeline/work/cord_public/` — the cord on a straight (arc, u, v) lattice with the discs, rootlet levels and conus tip measured on it — and `atlas-cord-public` **composes** them: one tube grid over the union of their coverage, each template level-matched to the Z-Anatomy vertebral column disc by disc, blended where they overlap, windowed once on the composite's own cord voxels. `atlas-manifest` then swaps the result into the `grids.cord` slot `filter_public` has just emptied, under exactly the same manifest keys, so nothing downstream has to know which edition it is looking at. Splitting the template from the compose is what lets a second dataset cover the cord below the first one's field of view without either step knowing about the other; either template alone still produces a complete, self-consistent volume.

*The source and its licence.* Ten T2w scans from the **spine-generic multi-subject public database** (NeuroPoly; Cohen-Adad et al., *Nature Protocols* 2021 [doi:10.1038/s41596-021-00588-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00588-0) and *Scientific Data* 2021 [doi:10.1038/s41597-021-00941-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00941-8)). The licence was checked against the repository itself at commit `718cbe8f`, and both files are downloaded and kept as the evidence: `LICENSE` is the verbatim **CC BY 4.0** legal code ("Attribution 4.0 International"), while `dataset_description.json` in the same commit says `"License": "CC0"`. The two disagree; the pipeline records the stricter of the pair, CC BY 4.0, and attributes accordingly (`pipeline/raw/spine_generic/LICENCE_VERIFICATION.txt`). Either permits redistributing derived files, which is the whole condition PAM50 fails. The images are git-annex objects; `git annex get` is the documented way to fetch them, but the dataset's own public Compute Canada / Alliance object store (the autoenabled `computecanada-public` `httpalso` remote in the repository's `git-annex` branch) serves each object over plain HTTPS at `<remote url>/<annex key>`, and the key is content-addressed (`SHA256E-s<bytes>--<sha256>`), so the URL pins the exact bytes and `sources.lock.yaml` re-verifies every digest. No git-annex install is needed.

*The subjects.* Ten healthy controls from four 3 T Siemens Prisma / Prisma-fit sites — Balgrist (01–04, 06), Cardiff CUBRIC (02, 04), CMRR Minnesota (02, 04) and Geneva (01) — all with the same spine-generic T2w protocol (0.8 mm isotropic sagittal, TR 1.5 s), none of them listed under `csa_t2` in the dataset's own `exclude.yml`, and all ten carrying the **manually corrected C2–T1 dorsal and ventral rootlet segmentations**, which is what the selection was made on. Four files per subject, all manual or validated ground truth shipped in the dataset's `derivatives/labels`: the image, the cord segmentation, the intervertebral disc labels and the rootlets.

*No Spinal Cord Toolbox.* Because every per-subject label SCT would have produced is already in the dataset, the build is pure numpy in `pipeline/atlas_pipeline/spine_generic.py`. Each subject is straightened along the centreline of its own cord segmentation (per-slice centroids, boxcar-smoothed, uniform arc-length resampling, the same anterior-referenced frame the reformat carries) onto a 0.5 mm (arc, u, v) lattice — `sct_straighten_spinalcord` in twenty lines, and the exact inverse of what the reformat then does. Arc length is measured from that subject's **C2/C3 disc**, the remaining disc labels give a piecewise-linear warp onto the group-mean disc positions (the inter-subject scatter that removes runs from 1.4 mm at C3/C4 to 8.8 mm at T2/T3 — real differences in cord length, which a translation alone would smear), intensities are normalised on two robust anchors measured inside the tube (the median of the cord itself and the 95th percentile of the CSF around it), and the stack is averaged with a per-arc subject count. The template keeps every arc bin with at least 7 of 10 subjects: **arc −37.5 to +136.0 mm from the C2/C3 disc**, about the foramen magnum to the T3/T4 vertebral level.

*Spinal levels from the rootlets, not from a rule of thumb.* "Spinal level ≈ vertebral level minus one" is a teaching approximation and is not good enough to ship as a measurement, so the levels are read off the rootlets instead: the boundary between segment *n* and *n+1* is the midpoint between the caudal end of the *n* rootlets and the rostral end of the *n+1* rootlets, averaged over the ten subjects. That gives **C2–T1, eight measured levels** 14.4–17.1 mm long. The LUT keeps the same 1 = C1 … 30 = S5 id space and the same shape as the private one, and `check-data` prints which ids the volume actually holds (`10 present in the volume (C2, C3, …, T3)`). The two outer boundaries have no rootlet group beyond them and are extrapolated by the median of the measured ones; `labels_spine_public.json` says so in `levelMethod`. *Below* the last measured level the compose step does fall back on the rule of thumb, because there is nothing else — but it says so: those ids are placed by the classical cord-segment-to-vertebra rule read off the same four Z-Anatomy landmarks `derived.py` cuts the public `-vert` cord blocks at (C8 ends at the C7/T1 disc, T12 at the T9/T10 disc, L5 at the mid-body of T12, S5 at the conus tip, put at the L1/L2 disc), each block divided equally among the levels it holds and clipped to where the composite has data. They carry `estimated: true` in the LUT, are listed under `levelMethod.estimated` with the rule spelled out, and the MNI readout names them **"T2 · thoracic segment (vertebral rule)"** rather than passing them off as a measurement. Vertebral levels, measured on the disc labels, ship beside them in `cord_levels_public.json` and are named as vertebral levels. One trap worth recording: the manual disc labels are **not** "label *n* = the disc below vertebra *n*". Checking them against the dataset's own TotalSpineSeg vertebral-body segmentation on `sub-balgrist01` (its C2/C3 disc, label 63 at z 4.8…14.4 mm, coincides with manual disc label **3**, not 2) shows that label 1 is a point at the top of C1 and label *n* ≥ 2 is the disc between vertebrae *n−1* and *n*. Reading it the other way puts the entire template one vertebral body too low.

*The whole spine, from the Fudan dataset.* The spine-generic field of view ends at about T3/T4, and no other openly licensed healthy-volunteer cord MRI was found for the thoracic cord until the **open-access lumbosacral spine MRI dataset** of Liu, Zhang, Zhou, Xu, Chu and Jia (*Scientific Data* 2024 [doi:10.1038/s41597-024-03919-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03919-4); figshare collection [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7372564](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7372564), every article CC BY 4.0, source `lumbosacral_fudan`, 1.2 GB) turned out to hold more than its name says: besides the lumbosacral CISS and DESS that resolve the nerve roots, each of the 14 healthy adults (22–25 y, Fudan University, ethics FE23166I) has a DICOM-composed four-station **whole-spine sagittal T2-TSE**, skull base to sacrum, 0.62 × 0.62 mm in plane and 3.3 mm across. It ships no cord segmentation and no disc labels, so `pipeline/atlas_pipeline/fudan_spine.py` finds both itself, still in pure numpy: the CISS conus outlines in the dataset's 3D Slicer markups (LPS scanner mm, the same session as the T2-TSE — checked on every subject, cord-to-CSF intensity ratio 2.1–3.9 at their centroids) seed the centreline and give the conus tip, a Viterbi pass up the image on a matched filter (a dark 4–6.5 mm disc between two bright CSF flanks, scored on the *dimmer* flank so the posterior epidural fat cannot capture it) tracks the cord to the foramen magnum and a second pass follows the bright thecal sac down to S2, and the 23 discs C2/C3 … L5/S1 are assigned by dynamic programming over an intensity profile taken just anterior to the canal wall (posterior annulus minus nucleus, which separates a disc from the basivertebral vein) with scaled vertebral-height priors, ganglion-marker anchors at the bottom and the dens at the top. Every subject yields all 23 discs; the conus tip lands at L1 in 11 and L2 in 3 (the classical distribution), the C2/C3-to-conus cord length is 420 ± 26 mm and the mean vertebral heights (C3 17.3, T6 25.2, T12 31.7, L1 36.2 mm) match the literature. Straightening, disc warping, normalisation and averaging then follow the spine-generic recipe, requiring 9 of 14 subjects per row: **arc −46 to +620 mm from the C2/C3 disc**, medulla to the end of the sac. The per-subject QA montages (`pipeline/qa/fudan_spine/`, centreline and discs drawn on each mid-sagittal image) are what the tracking was tuned against; `pipeline/qa/fudan_spine.json` keeps the numbers. Two properties of this template are worth knowing: it is sharp in the sagittal plane and blurred across it (3.3 mm slices), which is why the isotropic spine-generic template keeps precedence where the two overlap; and the group-mean vertebrae differ from the single Z-Anatomy specimen the atlas is built on — measured along the cord the model's neck is shorter and its thoracic vertebrae taller than the mean (an anisotropic affine registered the specimen to MNI on its head) — so keeping the template's discs on the model's discs compresses it by up to a fifth in the lower neck and stretches it by up to a third in the mid-thoracic region. That is a property of the model, not of the data, and the price of slices that agree with the vertebra meshes and the `-vert` cord blocks. Below the L2/L3 disc, where the Z-Anatomy cord and dura surfaces end, the compose step continues the centreline along the midline of the Z-Anatomy *cauda equina* surface through the lumbosacral canal (`canal_frame()`), so the template's sac lands in the model's sacral canal instead of running straight on along the cord's last tangent, which would have missed it by 70 mm at S1.

*Where it is laid down.* The reformat is `atlas-pam50`'s, shared rather than copied: `pam50.cord_frame()` measures our cord surface's centreline and carries the frame, `pam50.tube_grid()` builds the output grid and hands back each voxel as (arc, u, v), and each template supplies only its own way of turning that into a sample. What fixes *where* a template lands is the **Z-Anatomy vertebral column** — the same specimen and the same `zanatomy_to_mni.json` map the cord surface itself comes from, so nothing in the chain touches PAM50. Every `Intervertebral disc …` object is projected onto our centreline (the C2/C3 disc at arc 36.27 mm, world (0.0, −37.6, −107.4); the ladder runs on to L5/S1 at 671.8 mm), and each template's arc length is mapped onto ours piecewise-linearly through the discs the two have in common — exact at every shared disc, so the level-matching residual is zero by construction and what `cord_public.json` reports instead is the **stretch factor of each inter-disc segment** (0.90–1.11 for spine-generic, 0.81–1.33 for the Fudan template, flagged outside 0.85–1.15 and gated at 0.7–1.45 in `atlas-qa`). Beyond the outermost shared disc the slope is exactly 1, so the medulla band above C2/C3 is translated and never stretched. Where two templates overlap the first in precedence wins and hands over across the last 20 mm of its coverage with a smoothstep ramp; both are normalised the same way (cord median → 0.5, CSF 95th percentile → 1.0), so the blend is a plain intensity mix and the composite is windowed once, on its own cord voxels. With both templates the result is a 45 × 427 × 889 grid at 0.75 mm spanning z −718.2 to −52.2 mm, the whole cord and the lumbosacral sac: **1.12 MB gzipped for `cord_t2_public`, 49 KB for the levels**, against 760 KB for the private edition's PAM50 set (which stops at the conus). With spine-generic alone it is a 45 × 151 × 235 grid to z −227.5 mm and 161 KB.

*What it agrees with.* Two independent checks, both gated in `atlas-qa`. Against the MNI template, where the public cord grid overlaps the MNI T2w medulla (z −77 to −70 mm, 15 slices at 0.5 mm), the cord centre is **+0.13 ± 0.03 mm** in x and **−1.52 ± 0.04 mm** in y of the MNI medulla, **RMS 1.53 mm** (gate 2.5 mm) — so the brain MRI and the cord MRI join at the foramen magnum without a step. Against PAM50, which shares nothing with it — different subjects, a different straightening, a different anchor and rootlet-measured rather than template-estimated levels — the eight spinal levels land **2.0 ± 1.3 mm** (worst 4.0 mm) from where `atlas-pam50` puts the same levels on the same centreline, with segment lengths matching to about 1 mm. `node scripts/shots-public-cord.mjs` renders the join, the whole cord from brain to sacrum, the thoracic cord, the conus and cauda equina in the canal, the C5, T1 and T7 axial cords and the level bands into `qa/shots/public-cord-mri/` after asserting that the loaded manifest is the public one, that `grids.cord` is the composed public template under a redistributable licence, that the level under the mid-C5 point reads back as `C5` naming `spinal-segment-cervical-vert`, and that the cord MRI survives switching to the T1w contrast — this template is T2w only, so the app falls back to it rather than dropping the cord off the slice.

*And the request that would make all of this unnecessary.* `pipeline/raw/pam50/LICENSE_REQUEST_DRAFT.txt` is a drafted, unsent email to the PAM50 authors asking them to state a licence for the template data. If they do, the private cord MRI, the measured cord segment blocks and the PAM50-cut filum could all ship publicly and the two editions would differ by that much less.

**Where the outputs go.** In `public/data/` the plain names are the public edition on every machine, so a plain `npm run dev` or `npm run build` cannot leak; the private bundles sit beside them under `.private.json` names and are written only where restricted data was actually built:

| Command | Writes |
|---|---|
| `atlas-manifest` | `public/data/manifest.json` (the public edition, always) and `public/data/manifest.exclusions.json` (every excluded mesh, volume, licence and source with its reason); plus `public/data/manifest.private.json` when restricted data is in the build |
| `npm run content` (`node scripts/content/build.ts`) | `public/data/content.json`, `public/data/search-index.json`, `public/data/content.tr.json` |
| `npm run content:private` (`node scripts/content/build.ts --private`) | `public/data/content.private.json`, `public/data/search-index.private.json`, `public/data/content.tr.private.json` |
| `npm run build` | `dist/`, filtered down to what the public manifest references, then gated by `scripts/check-public.ts` |
| `npm run build:private` | `dist-private/`, where the private bundles take the ordinary `data/manifest.json`, `data/content.json`, `data/search-index.json` and `data/content.tr.json` names; nothing is filtered and no gate runs |

The content build validates the authored JSON against the **union** of the two manifests, so an entry is never wrong just because one edition drops its mesh — the editions do not ship the same cortex, and a gyrus entry legitimately names ids from both; only the bundle is filtered, and `content/` itself is never edited. A structure whose meshes are all gone keeps its full text with `meshIds: []`. An `MniRef` that pointed at a dropped mesh keeps its MNI coordinate (a location, not atlas data) and loses the mesh id, so "where to look" still moves the slices.

**In the app.** A public manifest simply has fewer meshes, so the tree omits them; the cord MRI toggle still hides itself when `grids.cord` is absent, which now only happens in a build where `atlas-spine-generic` has not run. Opening a structure whose mesh is gone — `#/structure/reticular-formation-medullary-inferior` — shows its content with a "No 3D mesh in this edition" notice instead of doing nothing.

**The gate.** `scripts/check-public.ts` walks the built `dist/` — `npm run build` runs it as its last step — and fails on an excluded mesh id anywhere, a restricted licence or source id in the data, a file the public manifest does not reference, a mesh or volume file that should have been dropped, or the strings `Harvard-Oxford`, `Diedrichsen`, `Brainstem Navigator`, `PAM50` in the manifest or volume metadata. Ids are matched as whole tokens — a quoted `"<id>"`, or `/<id>` with nothing that could continue it after — because the public edition ships ids that *extend* an excluded one (`spinal-segment-cervical-vert`, `raphe-magnus-anchor`) and a bare substring test would fail on their file paths. It reports, rather than fails on, two things it cannot honestly call leaks: ten ids that name both an excluded mesh and the authored entry describing it (`filum-terminale`, the cord segment blocks, the midline raphe nuclei — the entry keeps its own id, and in `data/manifest.json` the same id is a shipped mesh's `structureId`; a structural pass proves no mesh field points at them), and those dataset names where they appear in authored prose as citations and teaching notes ("the group probability map of the Brainstem Navigator…"). Naming a dataset is attribution, not redistribution. The app bundle is scanned for mesh ids only, because `src/ui/sourceLine.ts` and the cord toggle name licences and datasets in code.

**The repository guard.** `scripts/check-tree.ts` (`npm run check-tree`) gates the other way a restricted file could get out: the tracked tree itself. It reads the git index, needs no generated data, and fails on a tracked file under a path that must never be committed (`reference/`, `pipeline/raw/`, `pipeline/work/`, `public/data/`, `dist/`, `dist-private/`, `qa/shots/`, …), a tracked binary or volumetric data blob, a restricted licence or source id used as a field value in a committed data file, an excluded mesh id in a committed manifest-shaped file, a trace of the private book corpus, and — on the public branch — a restricted dataset sitting in a default `atlas-download` group. It is installed as a pre-commit hook by `npm run hooks:install` (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) and runs in CI. Mentions of the restricted datasets in the authored prose of `content/` are counted and printed, never failed on.

`tests/public-edition.test.ts` re-implements the exclusion rule in TypeScript, runs it over the real private manifest, and requires `atlas-manifest` to have dropped exactly the same set from the public manifest — so a change on either side shows up as a test failure — then checks that the private manifest, the private bundle and `content/` are untouched. `node scripts/check-data.ts --all` checks both manifests (`--manifest <file>` picks one, including `dist/data/manifest.json`).

## The exclusion is unconditional

**Nobody's use of this project is what makes publishing it safe. The exclusion is.** That distinction matters
enough to state plainly, because the obvious shortcut — "this is a non-commercial educational project, so the
non-commercial datasets are fine" — is wrong on every one of the four, and acting on it would publish material
we have no right to publish.

| Dataset | Why it is out | Does non-commercial use change it? |
|---|---|---|
| Brainstem Navigator | clause 2 forbids distributing the files, or anything derived from them, outside your organisation | **No.** The clause is about distribution, not about money. |
| PAM50 | the repository states no licence at all, so no permission to redistribute has been given | **No.** Absent permission is absent for everyone. |
| Diedrichsen cerebellum | CC BY-ND: adaptations may not be distributed, and the pipeline meshes the volume | **No.** ND restricts derivatives, and permits commercial use. |
| Harvard-Oxford | **held back pending review, not for a licence reason** — FSL relicensed it to CC BY-SA 4.0 on 2025-08-05 | Not applicable; it is no longer non-commercial. |

Two of the four are unaffected by commerciality because their restriction is on *distribution*, not on money.
A third turned out to restrict *derivatives*, which is the one thing a mesh pipeline unavoidably makes. Only
Harvard-Oxford was ever really a non-commercial question, and as of August 2025 it is not one either.

The outbound licence makes the same point from the other side. The data ships as **CC BY-SA 4.0**, which
requires that adaptations be shareable under the same terms. A CC BY-NC input cannot be relicensed into that,
and a CC BY-ND input cannot be adapted for distribution at all — so a build containing either could not
honestly carry the licence this one carries, whoever was running it and for whatever purpose.

**Do not add a build mode that includes the restricted data on the grounds that a particular use is
non-commercial.** There is no such mode and there should not be one: it would produce an artefact that looks
like the public edition, passes for it, and may not be shared. `npm run build:private` already exists for
building everything locally, and its output is marked do-not-publish for exactly this reason.

## Obtaining the restricted datasets

Everything above is about what the public edition leaves out. This is the other direction: what you have to do
to build the **private** edition yourself, dataset by dataset. You need this only if you want the original
Harvard-Oxford gyri, the Diedrichsen lobules, the Brainstem Navigator nuclei or the PAM50 cord — the public
edition substitutes all four and needs none of it.

**The gate comes first.** All four sit in `group: restricted`, and `atlas-download` refuses to fetch that group
unless it is on the `private` branch or told explicitly:

```bash
git switch private                      # or: export ATLAS_ALLOW_RESTRICTED=1
uv run --project pipeline atlas-download --with restricted
```

Asked for the group by name on a public branch it exits with

> `[restricted] the restricted group (harvard_oxford, diedrichsen_cerebellum, pam50, brainstem_navigator) is the private edition's data: its licences are non-commercial or forbid passing derived files on, so it may not be built on the public branch. Switch to the private branch, or set ATLAS_ALLOW_RESTRICTED=1 if you know what you are doing.`

`--with all` does not fail; it prints the same reason and carries on with every other group. Whatever you build
from these four is yours to keep locally: `npm run build` will not ship it, `check-public` fails if it tries,
and `check-tree` fails if any of it is committed.

| Dataset | Fetched by | Then run |
|---|---|---|
| Harvard-Oxford | `atlas-download --with restricted` | `atlas-atlas-meshes` |
| Diedrichsen cerebellum | `atlas-download --with restricted` | `atlas-atlas-meshes` |
| PAM50 | `atlas-download --with restricted` | `atlas-pam50` |
| Brainstem Navigator | **by hand — see below** | `pipeline/add_brainstem_navigator.sh` |

Then `atlas-manifest` (which writes `manifest.private.json` once restricted data is present) and `atlas-qa`.

**Harvard-Oxford (`FSL-NC`).** Five files from TemplateFlow — the cortical, subcortical and cortical-parcellation
segmentations plus their label tables — over plain HTTPS into `pipeline/raw/harvard_oxford/`. Nothing to
register for and nothing to click through.

The licence id is now misleading, and deliberately left alone. Checked against
[FSL's licence page](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/license.html) on 2026-09-09, which since 2025-08-05
says: *"The Cerebellum and Harvard-Oxford atlases, whilst not being the property of Oxford, are released under
the CC BY-SA 4.0 licence"* — carving them out of the non-commercial FSL software licence that still covers the
JHU, Juelich, Striatum and Thalamus atlases. **Harvard-Oxford is not non-commercial**, and CC BY-SA 4.0 is this
project's own outbound data licence, so it could ship. It does not, because removing the flag would add 96
parcels to the public edition and that is a decision about what to publish rather than a metadata fix. Two
things for whoever makes that decision: FSL grants these terms on data it says in the same sentence is not its
property, and the upstream holder (the Harvard CMA) states no terms at all. Cite Desikan et al. 2006, Makris et
al. 2006, Frazier et al. 2005 and Goldstein et al. 2007.

**Diedrichsen cerebellum (`CC-BY-ND`).** Two files — the probabilistic anatomical segmentation and its label
table — from the DiedrichsenLab `cerebellar_atlases` repository into `pipeline/raw/diedrichsen_cerebellum/`.
Nothing to register for.

The repository ships **no LICENSE file** — `LICENSE`, `LICENCE`, `LICENSE.md` and `COPYING` all 404, and
GitHub's own licence detection returns null. The only statement anywhere is the last line of its
[README](https://github.com/DiedrichsenLab/cerebellar_atlases#reference-and-licence): *"If not otherwise noted
in the contributing paper, the atlases are distributed under a Creative Commons license CC BY-ND (Attribution -
No derivatives)."* No version is given, which is why no verbatim legal code ships for it — we do not know which
one to ship. `Diedrichsen_2009/atlas_description.json` says `"License": "See LICENSE file"`, pointing at a file
that does not exist.

**ND, not NC**, and that is a firmer reason to exclude it than non-commercial ever was: the pipeline meshes the
volume, which makes a derivative, and CC BY-ND forbids *distributing* adaptations. Making them locally is
permitted, which is exactly what the private edition does. Commerciality has nothing to do with it. Cite
Diedrichsen et al., *NeuroImage* 2009.

**PAM50 (`PAM50-unlicensed`).** One release zip from
[spinalcordtoolbox/PAM50](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/PAM50), unpacked in place under
`pipeline/raw/pam50/`; `atlas-pam50` then looks for a `*/template/` directory beneath it. There is nothing to
agree to, and **that is the problem**: the repository ships no `LICENSE` file and states no terms, so the
pipeline treats everything derived from it as research-use-only and never redistributes it. Spinal Cord Toolbox
itself is LGPL-3.0, but that covers the code, not the template data. This is the one restriction here that
exists only because nobody has said otherwise, and
`pipeline/raw/pam50/LICENSE_REQUEST_DRAFT.txt` is a drafted, unsent letter asking the authors to state one; if
they do, the cord MRI and the PAM50-cut cord segments could ship publicly and the two editions would differ by
that much less. Cite De Leener et al., *NeuroImage* 2018.

**Brainstem Navigator (`BrainstemNavigator-NC-ND`) — the manual one.** This is the only dataset the pipeline
cannot fetch for you. NITRC serves it behind a click-through agreement, so `atlas-download --with restricted`
will only print

> `[manual] brainstem_navigator/BrainstemNavigatorv1.0.zip: place the file at … (download from …)`

and move on. Do this instead:

1. Open <https://www.nitrc.org/projects/brainstemnavig/>, and under **Download** accept the terms and take
   `BrainstemNavigatorv1.0.zip`. A NITRC account may be required. The direct link recorded in `sources.yaml`
   works only after the click-through, so use a browser.
2. Put the archive at `pipeline/raw/manual/BrainstemNavigatorv1.0.zip`, or at
   `pipeline/raw/brainstem_navigator/BrainstemNavigatorv1.0.zip`, or unpack it into
   `pipeline/raw/brainstem_navigator/`. (`atlas-brainstem-nav` looks in both places; `atlas-download` only ever
   looks in `pipeline/raw/brainstem_navigator/`, so its `[manual]` line names that one.)
3. Run `pipeline/add_brainstem_navigator.sh`, which does `atlas-brainstem-nav --inventory`, then
   `atlas-brainstem-nav`, then `atlas-manifest` and `atlas-qa`.

What you accept at the click-through is stricter than the other three, and it is the reason these meshes can
never be shared: non-commercial research use only, copies within your own organisation with the original
notices attached, **no distribution of the files or of anything derived from them outside your organisation**,
not for clinical use, and cite the papers in the toolkit's reference list. The verbatim terms are copied to
`public/data/licenses/BrainstemNavigator-NC-ND.txt` during the ingest, so they only appear after you have
agreed to them. The section below covers what the ingest builds.

## Brainstem Navigator

Brainstem Navigator nuclei **are** included in this local build but never in a shared one. The toolkit needs a manual NITRC download (click-through licence), and clause 2 of its terms forbids distributing the files, or anything derived from them, outside your organisation: the 65 meshes are therefore tagged `nc` + `noRedistribution` in the manifest (licence `BrainstemNavigator-NC-ND`, verbatim terms in `public/data/licenses/`), shown with an **NC** badge in the tree, and **must be excluded from any build that is published or shared**. To rebuild them: put `BrainstemNavigatorv1.0.zip` in `pipeline/raw/manual/` (or unpack it into `pipeline/raw/brainstem_navigator/`) and run `pipeline/add_brainstem_navigator.sh` (`atlas-brainstem-nav --inventory` first). The abbreviation-to-mesh table is `pipeline/config/brainstem_navigator.yaml`: all 47 abbreviations of the two MNI label trees are mapped, 12 that MASSP20/CIT168 already provide (SN, RN, STh, VTA, PAG, SC, IC, DR, MnR, PTg, LG, MG) are skipped as duplicates, and their 7 T subdivisions (SN1/SN2, RN1/RN2, STh1/STh2 and the reticular-formation parts) are built hidden and attached to the parent structure entry.
