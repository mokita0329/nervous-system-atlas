# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

One version number covers the whole atlas, because the three halves of it are only
meaningful together: the browser application in `src/`, the Python data pipeline in
`pipeline/` that builds the meshes, volumes, label maps and manifest, and the authored
content in `content/` with its bibliography and its Turkish overlays. The app reads a
manifest and a content bundle that the pipeline and the content build produced from the
same tree, so a change to any one of the three can move the version.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **An individual's MRI as a slice contrast.** `atlas-subject <scan> --id <id>` takes a NIfTI, a folder of
  DICOM files or the zip a hospital hands out (dcm2niix converts every series and the one that looks like a
  whole-head 3D T1 is taken; `--series` overrides) and carries the T1w
  into the atlas space — N4, rigid + affine + SyN onto the atlas's MNI T1w with the metric confined to the
  brain mask, a resample onto the 193×229×193 grid — defaces it with a fixed MNI-space shear plane derived
  from the template brain mask (a convex-hull facet, so it cannot cut brain; chosen by face voxels, because
  scoring the whole head left the orbits in), windows it like the template and writes
  `volumes/subject-<id>.u8.bin` with a sidecar recording tool, transform, similarity before and after SyN and
  the defacing. The fit is gated on normalised mutual information with the template (1.05; a good fit is
  1.08–1.11), which unlike correlation does not depend on the scan's contrast; tested on four OpenNeuro T1s
  from Siemens and Philips scanners and on dcm2niix's vendor DICOM sets, where the sets with no T1 in them
  and a QA phantom are refused rather than shipped. The default transform is the full
  `antsRegistrationSyN[s]` recipe (5–10 minutes): antspyx's quick `SyN` shortcut settled wrong on a
  flat-contrast paediatric scan (NMI 1.018) that the recipe registers correctly (1.082).
  The manifest lists it under `kind: "subject"` with its own source and licence; the viewer's
  contrast menu shows every subject scan after T1 and T2, `t` cycles through them, and `?c=subject-<id>`
  links work. `check-data`, `check-public` and `atlas-qa` refuse a subject volume that is undefaced,
  unattributed or under a restricted licence. QA renders in `pipeline/qa/subjects/<id>/` include the skin
  surface seen from the front.
- **Share view.** A toolbar button writes the exact scene into the address bar and the clipboard: camera
  position and target, the visible systems and per-mesh overrides, which slices are on, the peels, the pin,
  the contrast, the open panel and the syndrome side. A plain link still carries only the route, the slice
  positions and a non-default contrast or language, so ordinary URLs stay short; the long form is only
  written when asked for.
- **Quiz continuity.** Answers are kept in the browser (by vignette id) and survive a reload; the set can be
  narrowed to one type or difficulty or to the vignettes answered wrong; Restart clears everything.
- **A CI job on real data.** `checks.yml` gained an `integration` job that fetches the pinned public bundle
  with `npm run data` and runs the whole browser suite against it on pushes and on demand — teaching-mode
  exit, Mirror, a slower selection, links that survive slice moves and reloads, the share link. The runner
  has no GPU, so the specs scale their timeouts by four there, and the cord test now reads the level centres
  from the label volume the app loads rather than from a pipeline file the bundle does not ship.
- **The counts the docs quote are checked.** `citations:check` compares the citation, source and entry counts
  in README.md and docs/content.md with the live ones and fails on drift; `--fix` rewrites them. (They had
  drifted: 2384 citations across 824 entries, not 2387 across 825.)
- **One command each for running, checking and building.** `npm start` installs what is missing, fetches
  the data bundle once and serves the app; `npm run check` runs the whole check suite in order, skips what the
  machine cannot run and prints a summary (`--quick` leaves out the build and the browser tests);
  `npm run data:build` runs the pipeline end to end. The in-app "no data" message now says `npm start`.
- **An icon.** A brain with the three orthogonal MRI planes, in `docs/icon/` as the app icon, a monochrome
  version, a small-size version and the bare symbol; the app has a favicon and an Apple touch icon, and the
  README carries it.
- **Keyboard access.** The search box is a combobox over a listbox (arrow keys move `aria-activedescendant`,
  Enter takes the result) and a pathway's steps are buttons, reachable with Tab.

### Changed

- **The documentation is split by reader.** The README is sixty lines: the three-line quick start at the
  top, the screenshot gallery, the disclaimer and a table saying which document to read next; its Turkish
  mirror is `docs/README.tr.md`. The user guide (`docs/guide.md`, `docs/guide.tr.md`) has everything about
  using the app — what is in it, features, shortcuts, links and Share view, the Turkish edition,
  licences, limitations. A new developer guide (`docs/developing.md`) has everything past `npm start`:
  prerequisites, the three commands, where things are, how the data gets there, hosting a copy, showing your
  own MRI, building the data, the two editions, the checks and what CI runs. CONTRIBUTING.md is now only the
  rules — branches, what is never committed, content and translation rules, what a pull request needs — and
  AGENTS.md stays the operating manual.

### Fixed

- **The "reticulospinal tract" ran up into the cortex.** The HCP1065 tractography map the mesh came from
  (`projection/RST`) is the corticoreticular pathway: its streamlines run from the frontal cortex down to the
  pontomedullary reticular formation (z −50 to +74 mm in MNI, most of it above the brainstem) and stop at the
  upper medulla where the diffusion data end, so nothing of the tract's spinal course was ever in it. Shipped
  whole under the reticulospinal name it drew a descending brainstem tract in the cortex, which a reader
  reported. The map is now cut at the pontomesencephalic junction (z = −22 mm): above it is a new
  **Corticoreticular tract** entry (`tract-corticoreticular`, with its own prose, citations and Turkish
  overlay); below it the mesh ids `tract-reticulospinal-l/r` keep their names but show only the brainstem course
  through the pontine and medullary tegmentum, and the entry says so and points at the cord's white columns
  for the rest. The tract label volume painted on the slices is cut the same way. Both editions gain two
  meshes (587 public, 657 private).
- **Mirror left the lesion marker, the slices and the shown meshes on the original side.** Only the involved
  set changed; the layout ran only when the syndrome id changed. A side change is now a re-layout too (the
  authored camera preset is the one thing not re-applied, so the reader's angle survives).
- **Leaving a syndrome, a pathway, a topic or a quiz reveal could hide anatomy that was on screen before.**
  Each mode recorded a mesh as "shown by me" whenever it was not in the shown-overrides set, which includes
  meshes visible through their system's defaults, and then hid them on exit. All four now go through one
  `showForMode` lease that touches only meshes not visible at the time and restores each one's previous
  override exactly.
- **A slower earlier selection could move the slices and the camera to a structure no longer selected.**
  The load callback now checks that its structure is still the selection.
- **A state change made from inside a subscriber could be missed** by the subscribers already visited in
  that pass, so behaviour depended on subscription order. The store now repeats the pass until no subscriber
  changes state (with a guard against two of them ping-ponging forever).
- **A pathway lost its link.** The state-to-URL sync knew nothing about pathways, so moving a slice while
  reading one rewrote the hash to `#/slice?…` and a reload lost the pathway. The open pathway is now part of
  the panel state, selecting a waypoint keeps it open, and a navigation cancels any URL rewrite still queued
  from the state before it.
- An instant camera move now cancels a running tween instead of being overwritten by its next frame.

- A `?c=` link no longer loses to the first paint: two contrast loads were in flight and the slower one
  (usually T1) replaced the linked one. A texture is now applied only if it is still the chosen contrast, and
  one fetch per contrast is shared.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- **63 meshes had inside-out shells, 59 of them wholly inverted** — the right superior frontal gyrus among
  them, visible at first paint as a hollow trough, and before that the left superior parietal lobule and the
  right lateral occipital cortex a neurologist reported as "eroded". trimesh only repairs the winding of a
  watertight mesh; every glb is now wound outward shell by shell before it is written, and the pipeline QA
  fails any mesh that is not. The v1.0.1 notes blamed the "eroded" look on the label; that was wrong.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-09

The data bundle is now `atlas-data-v1.0.1.tar.gz`, attached to the v1.0.1 release. Every version gets its own
asset name from here on; the v1.0.0 asset was replaced in place three times, and each replacement broke the
Pages deploy once, because a pushed checksum pointed at an asset that had already changed underneath it.

### Added

- `npm run data` fetches the prebuilt public-edition data from the release asset into `public/data/`, checks
  its pinned SHA-256 before unpacking and removes any macOS AppleDouble twins the archive should not carry.
  A clone that skips it now starts and says what to run instead of dying in `JSON.parse` on Vite's HTML
  fallback (the `dataPresence()` plugin makes a missing `/data/*` file 404 honestly).
- A live demo on GitHub Pages, built by `.github/workflows/pages.yml` from the release asset — never from the
  repository — and gated by `check-public` before deploy.
- `AGENTS.md` (with `CLAUDE.md` pointing at it): setup, the non-negotiable rules, the two editions, the check
  suite, the source-adding flow and the gotchas that cost time.
- `docs/editions.md`: how to obtain each of the four restricted datasets, and "The exclusion is unconditional"
  — non-commercial use is not what makes the public edition safe to share; the exclusion is.
- Six more screenshots, all of the MRI with something read on it, and the whole README in Turkish after the
  English.
- Structure labels carry their side again — "Caudate nucleus (L)" / "(R)", "(Sol)" / "(Sağ)" in Turkish —
  which the tree had lost because both members of a pair resolve through one content entry.
- Five browser tests for the narrow-window layout.

### Changed

- **Licence records corrected at source.** Three atlases were filed under the `MNI` licence purely because
  TemplateFlow serves them from the same directory: the MIAL thalamus is CC BY 4.0 (per its sidecar), MASSP is
  Apache 2.0 (per its FigShare deposit), and nobody upstream states a licence for the FreeSurfer aseg of the
  template, which now says so (`MNI-FreeSurfer`). Harvard-Oxford is CC BY-SA 4.0 since August 2025, not
  non-commercial, and stays excluded as a documented hold; the Diedrichsen cerebellum is CC BY-ND, not
  CC BY-NC, and stays excluded because ND forbids the meshes. The shipped licence texts follow.
- **Palette.** The arteries are one red — a vessel is told apart by its course, not its tint — and the grey
  matter is spread apart: the closest pair of colours in the cerebrum was ΔE 0.5, below the just-noticeable
  difference, and every system now sits at ΔE ≥ 3.0 with its mean lightness unchanged. `palette()` in the
  manifest step now covers the CerebrA/DKT parcels, the FastSurfer cerebellum and the landmark anchors, which
  it had silently skipped.
- **Layout.** Below 1100 px the panels narrow; below 900 px they overlay the 3D view and start closed, so the
  canvas never loses its width. The toolbar no longer overflows a 768 px window sideways.
- The MRA arterial iso-surface is off at first paint: drawn over the named vessels it fused them into one mass.
- The Turkish edition and the content panel no longer print a raw English "left"/"right" in Turkish mode.

### Fixed

- **The left middle cerebral artery was a stub** — 800 triangles against 3142 on the right — because
  BodyParts3D has a concept for the right MCA (FMA50082) and none for the left. Both sides are now built from
  the same named parts (sphenoid, insular, middle temporal branch), 7478 triangles each, symmetric by
  construction.
- **Seven BodyParts3D duplicates of MNI-native structures no longer ship** — the whole brain, the cerebral
  hemispheres, the brainstem, the cerebellum and the lateral ventricles. Measured against the MNI meshes of the
  same structures they were 10–25 mm off (the hemispheres a mean 15–18 mm inside the cortex), which read as a
  second brainstem and a second, misaligned cortex. 585 public / 655 private meshes.
- **Cortical parcels no longer look eroded.** The holes were in the label, not the mesh — a two-voxel ribbon
  perforated by sulci — and each parcel is now closed with a 1-voxel ball before meshing, without moving any
  border.
- `npm run build` and `check-public` no longer require `manifest.exclusions.json`, which a fetched bundle does
  not contain; the gate runs in a reduced mode and says so.
- The content panel said "no 3D mesh in this edition" for entries whose shapes belong to other entries; the
  notice now appears only when the entry really has no geometry.
- `scripts/shots-public-edition.mjs` asserted things about the public edition that stopped being true when it
  got its own cord MRI.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-08

First public release. There is no earlier published version, so this section describes
what the project is rather than what changed since last time; the pre-release work that
produced it is summarised under [Development history](#development-history).

### Added

**The atlas.** A local, browser-based 3D atlas of clinical neuroanatomy with synchronised
MRI slices, arterial territory maps, pathway tracing, a syndrome and lesion mode, clinical
topics, a glossary and a quiz. Everything is expressed in one coordinate frame,
MNI152NLin2009cAsym RAS millimetres, so the meshes, the T1/T2 slices and the label
overlays line up exactly. The atlas is an educational reference and carries a
not-for-clinical-use disclaimer in the README and in the About panel.

**Application.** Vite, TypeScript and three.js. A tri-state structure tree with group solo
and defaults, a toolbar search over structures, pathways and syndromes, orbit/pan/zoom with
frame-rate-independent damping and touch support, click and double-click selection against
both the meshes and the MRI slice, and a content panel with tabs for overview, anatomy,
connections, function, blood supply, imaging, clinical, pitfalls and sources. Hash routes
address structures, pathways, syndromes, topics, the glossary and the quiz, so any view can
be linked to. Physically based materials over an anatomical palette, with a Quality toggle
that adds ambient occlusion, a soft key-light shadow and anti-aliasing; high-detail meshes
load lazily behind small stand-ins. Axial, coronal and sagittal slices with T1/T2, peel
mode, territory tint, label outlines and a cord MRI that switches itself on below the
foramen magnum.

**Data pipeline.** A `uv`-managed Python package (`atlas-download`, `atlas-volumes`,
`atlas-bp3d-select`, `atlas-register`, `atlas-bp3d-meshes`, `atlas-atlas-meshes`,
`atlas-venat`, `atlas-lc-metamask`, `atlas-aan`, `atlas-derived`, `atlas-labels`,
`atlas-pam50`, `atlas-spine-generic`, `atlas-fudan-spine`, `atlas-cord-public`,
`atlas-manifest`, `atlas-qa`) that downloads and digest-pins its sources, resamples volumes
onto the MNI grid, meshes label masks through a signed-distance path with Taubin smoothing,
per-class triangle budgets and cross-parcel welding, landmark-registers the BodyParts3D and
Z-Anatomy specimens into MNI, constructs the meshes no source ships, and writes the
manifest the app reads. Generated data under `public/data/` is not committed.

**Two editions.** The private edition is 662 meshes and is everything the pipeline can
build; it stays local, because Harvard-Oxford, the Diedrichsen cerebellar atlas, the
Brainstem Navigator 7 T nuclei and the PAM50 cord template may not be redistributed. The
public edition is 592 meshes and is what may be shared, under Apache 2.0 for the code and
CC BY-SA 4.0 for the data and content. In it those four are replaced by CerebrA/DKT
cortical parcels, a FastSurfer CerebNet cerebellum, landmark-anchored brainstem markers, an
openly licensed locus coeruleus meta-mask, and a cord MRI composed here from spine-generic
and Fudan whole-spine data. A dataset leaves the public edition when its licence record is
flagged non-commercial or no-redistribution, and nothing else is special-cased. The public
edition is what `npm run build` produces and what `check-public` gates, so the default build
is the checked one; the full edition is `npm run build:private` and never leaves the machine.

**Content.** 825 authored entries: 379 structures, 12 cranial nerves, 25 pathways, 125
syndromes, 19 topics, 205 glossary terms and 60 quiz vignettes. All prose is original,
validated against zod schemas, and checked for cross-links, word minimums, spelling and
overlap against a private reference corpus. Every mesh in the manifest has an entry.

**Citations.** 2387 citations to 657 open-access sources — StatPearls chapters on the NCBI
Bookshelf, open-access articles in PubMed Central, and openly licensed reference pages — so
every claim can be read and checked without a paywall. No printed textbook is cited
anywhere in the shipped atlas. Bibliography entries are only ever marked verified by a tool
reading live source metadata, and the citation check fails on a malformed citation, an
unknown reference, an unverified entry or an entry nothing cites.

**Turkish edition.** A TR/EN switch kept in the URL hash and in `localStorage`, 289
interface strings typed against the English table, FIPAT TA2/TNA Latin terms applied to 227
entries with Turkish search synonyms, and the clinical prose of all 825 entries translated
as overlays under `content/i18n/tr/`, pinned to the hash of their English source. The
Turkish prose is machine-assisted and is awaiting review by a Turkish neurologist; the
interface says so.

**Licensing and provenance.** Apache 2.0 for the code, CC BY-SA 4.0 for the data and the
content, a `NOTICE` generated from `pipeline/config/sources.yaml` so every source's licence
travels with the build, and an About and credits panel that shows the same records in the
app.

**Checks.** TypeScript typecheck, Vitest unit tests, Playwright end-to-end smoke tests,
`check-data` over the generated data, `check-public` over the public build, the content
build's own validation and the pipeline's `atlas-qa` gates.

### Fixed

Late fixes made while preparing this release:

- `characteriztic` misspelling corrected in the 27 entries that carried it (7 structures, a
  pathway, 11 syndromes, 5 topics, 3 glossary terms), with the Turkish overlays re-pinned to
  the new English source hashes.
- Wallenberg syndrome said the palate "droops to the intact side", which reverses the sign.
  The nucleus ambiguus is ipsilateral, so the palate sags on the side of the lesion and the
  uvula is pulled to the intact side, as the cited StatPearls chapters and every other entry
  in the atlas already had it. Corrected in English and Turkish.
- Connection `from`, `to` and `via` values are rendered as named cross-links instead of raw
  entry ids, in both languages.
- The toolbar no longer wraps buttons onto a clipped second row: the search box had
  collapsed to a few pixels at 1400px and whole buttons disappeared in Turkish. It now sheds
  the subtitle, the counts, the screenshot button and finally the camera presets as the
  window narrows, and the search input never drops below 200px.
- Turkish mode carries a dismissible notice, repeated in the About panel, that the clinical
  prose is machine-assisted and under specialist review.
- The deficits table is laid out with fixed columns, so its substrate column no longer
  overflows the 420px panel and is cut off; the syndrome bar's step text has a flex basis,
  so the bar is a bar rather than a tall narrow column over the scene.
- Following a link to a structure from the topic, glossary, quiz or About panel now leaves
  that panel, even when the structure was already the selected one.
- A label table naming a mesh the loaded edition does not ship no longer throws while the
  overlay LUTs are rebuilt.
- The About panel says where a source with no download URL came from (built by this
  pipeline, or read live from an API) instead of showing no provenance at all.

## Development history

47 commits between 2026-09-05 and 2026-09-07, before any version was published. They are
grouped by theme below rather than listed in order; short hashes are given so the actual
commits can be found.

### Bootstrap, data pipeline and registration (2026-09-05 – 2026-09-06)

- `59de8dc` Bootstrapped the atlas: the corpus tools, the MNI mesh and volume pipeline
  (`download`, `volumes`, `meshing`, `atlas_meshes`, `labels`, `manifest`, `spaces`, the
  source catalogue and its lock file) and a first three.js viewer.
- `e7b73d6` Added the content schema, the content build, the hash router and the content
  panel, together with the first content batch (arteries and territories, 32 entries) and
  the BodyParts3D structure selection.
- `75ae25d` Landmark-affine registration of BodyParts3D into MNI, with 54 registered meshes
  — vessels, the optic pathway, orbital nerves, cord and meninges — alongside content
  batches 2 and 3.
- `92fae4d` Split and corrected the vertebral arteries, anchored the Z-Anatomy midbrain,
  and put spinal-level labels into the interface.

### Mesh building (2026-09-05 – 2026-09-06)

- `3f7710a` Z-Anatomy export from Blender (`bpy`) plus its landmark registration, adding 117
  nerve, sinus and nucleus meshes for 540 in total.
- `aa02fef` Filled in the missing meshes and scaffolded the Brainstem Navigator ingest.
- `ede5bee` Brought in the Brainstem Navigator 7 T nuclei and corrected the sub-cranial
  registration, alongside the first cord MRI (below).

### Content authoring (2026-09-05 – 2026-09-06)

Written in numbered batches with the Python authoring helpers in `tools/author/`.

- `ee10b7a`, `f3662ab`, `a30e422`, `82a917d`, `36f6431` Batches 4 to 12: cerebellum,
  ventricles and CSF, diencephalon, the cortical lobes, limbic and white matter, basal
  ganglia, spinal cord, meninges, venous sinuses, peripheral nerves, plexuses, the
  neuromuscular junction, autonomics and ganglia, then cranial nerves I–XII — 198 entries by
  the end of it.
- `5d2e88c` Batch 13: 25 pathways and the pathway panel route.
- `3eb05e4`, `1313e7b` Batch 14: 103 syndromes across vascular, lacunar, cortical,
  brainstem, cerebellar and cranial nerve territory.
- `df37cfa` Batches 15 and 16: extended structures and syndromes (356 of 359).
- `03c6245` The first glossary (67 terms) and quiz deck (30 vignettes) with their panels and
  routes.
- `f6cfcc4`, `624c702` The topic kind end to end (schema, build, panel, router) with 92 new
  structure entries for cortical, limbic, diencephalic, brainstem, pallidal and cerebellar
  meshes, then entries for every remaining tract, arterial territory and reference mesh,
  reaching zero manifest structures without content.
- `0ef4802` 19 clinical topics and 18 further Z-Anatomy meshes (cutaneous and plexus nerves,
  spinal grey and white matter) with their entries; the plagiarism check at zero hits.
- `149c6a2` 138 more glossary terms, 30 more quiz vignettes, a topic end-to-end test, a
  panel and selection fix, and the README counts.

### Citations migrated to open access (2026-09-06)

- `aa02fef` Migrated every citation in the atlas to open-access sources — StatPearls
  chapters and PubMed Central articles — with the citation tooling in `tools/cite/`
  (`catalog.py`, `migrate.py`, `statpearls.py`, `oa.py`) that harvests the chapter catalogue,
  scores candidates by a rarity-weighted title match, reads section names from the live
  chapter rather than guessing them, and records the decisions the automatic pass cannot
  make.

### Rendering and interaction (2026-09-05 – 2026-09-07)

- `2c5d577` Syndrome mode: the bar, the panel, the lesion marker, the deficit stepper, the
  mirror control and the toolbar search box.
- `b85ce48` Fixed the MNI reference resolver clobbering pathway waypoints, kept ids out of
  the spelling normaliser, and added the README and the bundle tests.
- `eed77a7` Leaving the quiz panel no longer clears the syndrome highlights.
- `a06d555` Added the `atlas-qa` gate step, an arterial source alias, and clearer involved
  and dimmed materials.
- `dcbf182`, `e6df5ee` Playwright smoke tests (load, tree select, syndrome route, quiz and
  glossary) and the ignore rules for their artefacts and the Blender venv.
- `3b861ea` The empty syndrome bar hides itself when no syndrome is active, via the `hidden`
  attribute rather than a display rule.
- `2c6bde2` Fixed pointer input: hidden overlays no longer cover the canvas. Richer orbit
  controls, double-click focus, a click threshold, and an end-to-end pointer test.
- `88853ce` Physically based rendering and higher-detail geometry, with the reference-shot
  and montage scripts used to compare before and after.
- `37626e5` The `p` shortcut peels at the slice last toggled with `a`, `c` or `s`, not only
  the axial one.
- `32c377b` Cast the citations against the typed entry in the panels.

### The spinal cord MRI (2026-09-06 – 2026-09-07)

- `ede5bee` The private edition's cord MRI: `atlas-pam50` curve-reformats the straightened
  PAM50 template onto the centreline of the atlas's own cord surface, with a spinal-level
  label volume on the same grid. Smoother interaction, group toggles and more specific
  references landed with it.
- `94cfc54` A first public-edition cord from the spine-generic multi-subject database,
  alongside the other public-edition mesh work below.
- `bf29aef` Registered the Fudan whole-spine dataset (CC BY 4.0) and added the
  `atlas-fudan-spine` and `atlas-cord-public` steps.
- `d5ec412` A whole-cord public MRI: the Fudan whole-spine T2 template composed with
  spine-generic by `atlas-cord-public`, so the public edition's slices now run the length of
  the cord and into the sac.

### The public edition and the redistribution gate (2026-09-06 – 2026-09-07)

- `2a5c2ae` Apache 2.0 for the code, CC BY-SA 4.0 for the data and the content, a generated
  `NOTICE`, and the About and credits panel.
- `b019be7` Split the build into public and private editions: a separate public build,
  `check-public`, the manifest's edition filter, and the tests and shots that guard them.
- `222aca8` CC0 CerebrA/DKT cortex and an `aseg` cerebellum for the public edition, plus the
  CC BY locus coeruleus meta-mask.
- `a6059eb` Landmark-anchored brainstem markers, the AAN atlas scaffold and the
  public-edition cord blocks.
- `48aa717` Imported the Harvard Ascending Arousal Network atlas ROIs into the public
  edition and wired them into the entries.
- `94cfc54` FastSurfer cerebellar lobules, open-sized markers for every brainstem nucleus,
  the vertebral filum and the spine-generic cord MRI.
- `7f94ad8` The not-for-clinical-use disclaimer in the README and the About panel, and the
  BodyParts3D licence record updated to CC BY 4.0 with the share-alike chain verified.

### Turkish edition (2026-09-07)

- `6f0b6aa` The terminology review table: `tools/i18n/terms.py` matches every structure,
  cranial nerve and pathway to FIPAT TA2 and TNA, Wikidata and Turkish Wikipedia.
- `0c937d2` Added a relation column to the review (exact, synonym, narrower, broader, fuzzy,
  related, none), related FIPAT terms for umbrella entries and subdivision notes between TA2
  and TNA; exact-name matches now outrank synonym clusters, so the lateral corticospinal
  tract resolves to TA2 6095 rather than the pyramidal tract.
- `051dc82` The apply step: FIPAT Latin terms (TNA first, TA2 as the fallback) and Turkish
  search synonyms written into 227 entries, `names.tr` and `synonymsByLang.tr` added to the
  schemas, search index and content types, and the four terminology sources registered in
  `sources.yaml` with their own section in `NOTICE`.
- `336466a` The Turkish interface: the locale switch (shortcut `L`) kept in the URL hash and
  `localStorage`, 289 interface strings in `src/i18n/{en,tr}.ts`, Latin structure names with
  the English name as a secondary line, an English tag on untranslated prose, a bilingual
  About panel, unit and end-to-end tests and `scripts/shots-tr.mjs`.
- `881efab` The Turkish prose pipeline: `content/i18n/tr/<kind>/<id>.json` overlays pinned to
  the hash of their English source, checked by `tools/i18n/prose.py` and applied by the
  content build into `content.tr.json`, which the app fetches the first time Turkish is
  selected; `STYLE-tr.md` for the translators.
- `4a26d9c` The Turkish clinical prose itself: 825 overlays across structures, cranial
  nerves, pathways, syndromes, topics, glossary and quiz, written against `STYLE-tr.md`,
  checked with no errors and terminology-normalised. `content.tr.json` ships in both
  editions and `check-public` treats it like the English bundle.
